# [JSL01] Submission: Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge

# Brief

Imagine you are building a virtual pet adoption website, and you need to create a JavaScript function that checks if the user has
entered valid pet adoption details. Write a function that takes a string as input and validates if it follows a specific syntax, starting with "pet_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers. If the input follows the syntax, return "Valid Syntax"; otherwise, return "Invalid Syntax."

# Challenges

Figuring out how to give a case for characters evaluation upon input was a bit tricky because I had an Idea of what I could do but nit how to write it.
